# #100DaysOfCode Progress Log

### DAY 1: MARCH 7~8 2020

##### selflove: svg + animejs + gatsbyjs

**PROGRESS**:

- learned some basic animejs + anime-react animations / same animation settings produce different results
- learned that i can import an svg via `<img>` tag, but gives me limitations, like not being able to change fill color
- started setting up a gatsby project, got more familiar with props

**THOUGHTS:**

- started with 100-days-of-code repo, then decided i wanted use a gatsby-starter for seo-friendly powress
- ran through some issues creating a production build on gatsby - posted my [first issue on gatsbyjs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22066), let's see if people are nice.
- i think i'm doing a little too much at once, i need to be patient and resist my conjuring ways. i want to slow down and understand what's going on.
